# Language Learning Application

This project has been developed in today's world where language learning opportunities have greatly expanded through various mobile applications. Among the most popular options are interactive applications with language teachers. However, these applications are often quite costly.

In this project, I have designed an application to facilitate learning English through practical exercises supported by a large language model (LLM).

## Features

- A chat bot has been integrated using the Microsoft Dialog language model on the chat page.
- For listening exercises, gTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) artificial intelligence-supported text-to-speech conversion method has been integrated. This provides an opportunity for auditory learning without requiring any audio files.
- Exercises are provided in various areas such as grammar and reading practice.
